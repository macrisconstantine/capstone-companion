# Companion for Pots of Pottimea
This project is the implementation of a LLM-powered companion for my game Pots of Pottimea. It served as my capstone project.
## Game Description
- Small RPG heavily inspired by the Zelda series.
- Developed in C# in Unity.
## Companion Description
- The brain of the companion is the OpenHermes LLM found on HuggingFace at TheBloke/OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B-GGUF
## Instructions to run
- Download all files (Code>Download ZIP).
- Extract and ensure all game files remain in a common directory.
- Run the ```TheSmasherOfPots.exe``` file.
## Important note
NOTE: Uploading the gguf file to GitHub is tricky, so the project zip can also be downloaded here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1w5Jk_ZD2wliu4Ciqc1jQxWmswTM5oK2Z?usp=drive_link
